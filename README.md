# Attack of the nullptrs

Attack of the nullptrs is a game created on the 22nd of January 2017 by Guillaume Noguera, Florian E. Fasmeyer, and CÃ©dric Pahud. The game was developed as part of the C++ P2 project during our 2nd year of Computer Science.

We were instructed to create a simple desktop application with buttons and visuals using C++'s famous Qt library. We complied with the requirements...

... and made a whole game out of it.

We created our own game engine and hand-made everything:

* Collisions
* Physics
* Procedural Cave Generation
* Enemy Behaviors
* Health System
* Dynamic Player Camera
* Weighted Jumps Controls
* Animation Engine
* Pixel-Art Visuals
* 8-bit Music

This game includes:

* A stylish, ginger-mustached hero with a cowboy hat
* Null Pointers trying to hunt you through the caves
* Two doors delimiting the entry and exit points of a level
* Thrilling music
