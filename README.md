# Attack-of-the-nullptrs

Attack of the nullptrs is a game created on the 22th of january 2017 by Guillaume Noguera, Florian E. Fasmeyer and CÃ©dric Pahud. The game was created as part of the C++ P2 project, during our 2nd year of Computer Science.

We were instructed to create a simple desktop application with buttons and visuals with C++'s famous Qt library. We complied with the requirements...


... and made a whole game out of it.

We created our own game engine, and hand-made everything: 
* Collisions
* Physics
* Procedural Cave Generation
* Enemy Behaviours
* Health System
* Dynamic Player Camera
* Weighter Jumps Controls
* Animation Engine
* Pixel-Art Visuals
* 8-bits Musics

This game includes: 
* A stylish ginger moustached hero with a cowboy hat
* Null Pointers trying to hunt you through the caves
* Two doors delimiting the entry and exit point of a level
* A thrilling music
